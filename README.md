## Introduction
Many casino games that we see and hear of rely purely on skillâ€”examples include the famous roulettes, slots, etc.â€”however, Blackjack stands out as one in only a handful of games where strategy matters.

In September 1956, a paper titled *The Optimum Strategy in BlackJack* was released by Baldwin et al., calculating the optimum play for every hand; six years later, Edward Thorp published his book  *Beat the Dealer: A Winning Strategy for the Game of Twenty-One*, where he used an IBM computer (the IBM 704, using Fortran) to fine-tune the math.
